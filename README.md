# Project Objective

1. Collect code samples from public code repositories.
2. Run static analysis to extract metrics.
3. Detect code smells and annotate quality levels.
4. Engineer features fro code structure and static metrics.
5. Train ML model(s) for overall quality prediction.
6. Evaluate model(s) performance and accuracy.
7. Provide insights and improvement suggestions based on predictions.
